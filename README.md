# American_Sign_Language_Detection_App

## Overview

This project aims to develop an AI model capable of predicting American Sign Language (ASL) gestures. The model leverages machine learning techniques and is implemented using Python.

## Repository Structure

- `ASL_model_collab.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the development and training process of the ASL prediction model.
- `gradio_model.py`: Python script to run the model with a Gradio interface.
- `main_streamlit.py`: Python script to deploy the model using Streamlit.
- `smnist_X5_lite.tflite`: Pre-trained TensorFlow Lite model for ASL prediction.
- `README.md`: Project documentation (this file).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Utchash007/American_Sign_Language_Prediction-AI_Project.git
   cd American_Sign_Language_Prediction-AI_Project
   ```
